## Purpose

Atlas2 is a Rust service that connects Telegram groups to Codex sessions running remotely.

Core product behavior:
- Each Codex session is represented by a separate Telegram group.
- A session must run from a selected project folder on the VPS.
- Users send messages in Telegram and receive Codex output back in Telegram.
- When Codex requires approval or action, Atlas2 must present that as Telegram buttons.
- Atlas2 is a proxy/orchestrator, not a replacement for Codex itself.

---

## General Rules

- Always study the codebase before making changes.
- Never guess about existing behavior, architecture, or intent. Read the relevant code first.
- If the codebase and docs are insufficient to make a safe decision, ask the user for clarification.
- After making code changes, restart the Atlas2 process and verify it is running before handoff. Do not assume the bot is still up.
- Avoid emojis.
- Avoid adding documentation files unless truly necessary. Prefer updating existing docs first.
- If project structure or ownership changes, update `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and any relevant existing docs.

---

## Product Rules

- The primary UX is Telegram groups.
- One Telegram group maps to one Codex session.
- One Codex session must have one explicit working directory.
- Never run a session without a known, validated entry-point folder.
- Folder selection is a first-class requirement, not an optional enhancement.
- Approval requests from Codex must be surfaced as Telegram buttons whenever possible.
- Telegram should receive Codex output as streamed progress updates, not only final results.
- Preserve session isolation. Messages, state, approvals, and working directory must not leak across groups.

---

## Architecture Rules

- Apply strict separation of concerns.
- Keep Telegram transport concerns separate from Codex process management.
- Keep session state management separate from Telegram handlers.
- Keep filesystem/project-folder validation separate from business orchestration.
- Keep infrastructure adapters focused on external systems only:
  - Telegram Bot API
  - Codex CLI process execution
  - database/storage
  - filesystem access
- Keep business logic in services, not in Telegram handlers or process wrappers.
- Do not hide business rules inside:
  - Telegram update handlers
  - inline process-spawning code
  - database query helpers
  - ad-hoc utility functions
- Prefer explicit domain concepts over loose maps and stringly-typed state.

---

## Rust Rules

- The project should be written in Rust.
- Prefer boring, explicit Rust over clever Rust.
- Keep modules small and responsibility-focused.
- Prefer composition over large, stateful god-objects.
- Avoid massive files. Split modules when responsibilities start mixing.
- Use strong types for IDs and important state where practical:
  - session IDs
  - Telegram chat/group IDs
  - project/workspace IDs
  - approval/action IDs
- Avoid passing raw strings everywhere for domain concepts that deserve types.
- Keep handlers thin:
  - parse input
  - authenticate/authorize
  - call service layer
  - map result to response/output
- Keep services responsible for:
  - business rules
  - validation
  - orchestration
  - state transitions
- Keep repositories/adapters responsible for:
  - persistence
  - external API calls
  - process I/O
  - filesystem I/O
- Do not place business policy in repositories or Telegram callback handlers.
- Prefer `Result`-based error handling with explicit error types.
- Return actionable errors. Avoid vague failures.
- Use async only where it helps I/O and streaming. Do not introduce unnecessary async complexity.

---

## Testing Rules

- Add tests for every new behavior boundary you introduce.
- Prefer focused tests over broad, fragile end-to-end tests.
- Test at the layer where the rule lives:
  - service tests for business rules and state transitions
  - adapter tests for Codex/Telegram integration behavior
  - path validation tests for project folder safety
  - handler tests for callback routing and request parsing
- Cover failure paths, not only happy paths.
- For session logic, test:
  - session creation
  - folder validation
  - group-to-session mapping
  - streaming state updates
  - approval flow
  - invalid or repeated approval clicks
- Do not rely on compilation as proof of correctness.

---

## Documentation Rules

- Keep documentation concise and accurate.
- Update existing docs when architecture or behavior changes.
- Do not create speculative docs for features that do not exist yet.

## Change Checklist

Before handing off a change, verify:
1. The codebase was studied first.
2. The change respects the Telegram-group-per-session model.
3. The session has an explicit validated working directory.
4. Business logic remains outside handlers/adapters.
5. The change does not break session isolation.
6. Relevant tests were added or updated.
7. Relevant docs were updated if needed.
8. No unnecessary files or abstractions were introduced.
9. The Atlas2 process was restarted after the change and verified to be running.
